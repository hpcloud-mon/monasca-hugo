Monasca supports an optional monitoring agent that is written in Python. <!--more--> The agent supports the following checks and metrics:

1. System metrics, such as cpu, memory, network, disk and file-system utilization.
2. Service metrics, such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and many others.
3. Statsd
4. Nagios: The Monasca Agent can run any Nagio check and convert the results to a metric and send to the Monasca API. Status code and messages are sent as 'value_meta" in the metric.
5. Check_mk

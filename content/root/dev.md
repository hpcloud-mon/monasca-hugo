Monasca is an active project seeking to be a part of the OpenStack community and welcomes new development.<!--more-->

#### OpenStack Community

We have [submitted](https://review.openstack.org/#/c/213183/) to be included into OpenStack and follow OpenStack
[contribution guidelines](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute) and [code standards](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/hacking/).

Our project has a [launchpad site](https://launchpad.net/monasca) which is used for bug tracking. The project mailing list is also hosted on launchpad,
see the [team page](https://launchpad.net/~monasca) for details on that.

Details on the team meetings are found on this [OpenStack wiki page](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Monasca).

#### Code Contributions

While we await our full inclusion into OpenStack our code is hosted as part of stackforge and can be found [here](https://github.com/stackforge?query=monasca)

The [Monasca Vagrant](/dev/vagrant/) environment is the primary setup used for development of Monasca. More information on testing Monasca can be found
at our [testing page](/dev/testing/)
